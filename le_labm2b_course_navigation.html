		   <h1> M2B: Course Navigation </h1>
	
			<h2> These are the three navigation items I have noticed most: </h2>
			
			<dl>
			
				<dt class="lightYellow">Class Progress</dt>
					<dd>Class Progress is the most interesting because it
					shows all the statistics of all of my discussion posts and the grades I have received for 
					quizzes and assignments. It also compares the total time I spend on this site 
					to other members of the class.</dd>
					<dt class="lightYellow">Quizzes</dt>
					<dd>Quizzes are a necessary item which I will use to access the quizzes. 
					There is not much more to say about this Quizzes item except for that I will be accessing 
					it at least once a week.</dd>
					<dt class="lightYellow">Discussions</dt>
					<dd>The Discussions item is as important as the Quizzes item. 
					Since much of the homework in this course is submitted using the Dicussion Board, I
					will find myself spending most of my time with this section of the course. I also have 
					found some very helpful hints in this section.</dd>
				
			</dl>
			<h2> These are the other helpful items on the site: </h2>
			<dl>
			
			<dt class="lightGreen">Setting</dt>
			<dd>The Setting item allows me to change my profile. I have tried to explore
			it and was able to attach a picture for my avatar. However, I still do not know how to put
			a link of my email and message to my avatar like the other members had done. I will
			explore this function some more and will try to use it more effectively.</dd>
		<dt class="lightGreen">Bell</dt>
			<dd>I am glad the Bell is present. When there is a reply to my post,
			the Bell notices me with a yellow sticker. When I click on it, it takes me directly to
			the reply. Without this feature, I would have to go digging around to see whether anyone has
			replied to my posts. That would be a bit time consuming.</dd>
			<dt class="lightGreen">Print</dt>
			<dd>The Print item should allow me to print material from this site. 
			I have not used it yet, but I am sure at some point, I will need to print some note from this course.
			With this function, I don't have to make copies of the text and then print it, I can print it 
			directly from the page.</dd>
