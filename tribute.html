				<p>Mahatma Gandhi was an Indian lawyer who led India's independence movement against the British. He inspired other famous civil right leaders such as Dr. Martin Luher King Jr. who also employed the non-violence to fight for civil justice. As a teenager, Mahatma started eating meat. However, he later became committed to being a vegetarian and joined The London Vegetarian Society. He was influenced by the Hindu religion and adopted a life of simplicity.</p>

				<p>At The Vegan Deer, we are honored that great people like Mahatma Gandhi are vegetarians. We are also inspired by them to become vegetarians ourselves.</p>
