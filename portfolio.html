				<p>Welcome to my personal portfolio. My name is Kim. I am a student at CPCC enrolling in the Web Development Program. My goal for learning this skill is so I can build websites for small businesses and charity organizations. I am excited about this new adventure and hope to be a part of this amazing profession.</p>
